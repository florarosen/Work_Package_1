Materials and Methods :

1. Participants
XX CI users ( XX females, mean age ), XX age-matched controls. All are post-lingually deafened patients : Mean age at implantation, side of implantantion,
age at onset of hearing impairment,lenghth of sensory deprivation before implantation.
XX AB, XX Cochlear, XX Med-EL
Controls : age-matched, no hearing impairment (prevoir test audio?), right-handed (?), no neurological disease

Stimulus presented in free-field condition, with one or two ? loud speakers placed 1m in front of the patient.
Patient confortably seated
Task during EEG : - visual fixation or sound detection ? (pb : would increase the number of trials because need to be discarded)

2. Stimulus

- Amplitude modulation depth ? Comment déterminer
- Lenght of total sequence : integer ratio of the whole sequence; how long ?
- Number of trials :


3. EEG recording
BioSemi 64 Ag-Ag active electrodes, 10-20
CI under cap , do not fill with gel the closest electrodes to
Sampling rate :
Ground :
Reference :
Patient preparation :
  Exfoliate nose and mastoids with Nuprep gel on a Qtip, wipe excess off
  Put electrode washer (2 sided sticky circle on each electrode) + Place a bit of gel in the electrode + then stick electrode on mastoids (EXG1 + EXG2) and nose (EXG3)
  Cap : Measure participants head between occipital and nasion to chose appropriate size of cap.
        Patient holds the front of the cap while you pull it backwards
        Center Cz mid saggital and mid coronal (tragus to tragus)
        10-20 system : FPz should be located 10% of the distance between nasion and inion
        Plug in each electrode and check the offset on screen (NOT a measure of impedance !!) : if offset is high : electrode is not plugged in, is dead or doesn't have enough gel
Instructions to patient :
  - Participant should relax and avoid muscle contraction (show on the screen the effect of eye blinks/movements and neck movements)
  - Cell phone outside of the booth
  - Task explanation :
    - You will hear xx sequences of sounds that last for xx seconds, try and pay attention, some will be slightly different"
    - "I will ask you in between each set if you want to take a small break, move around a bit or continue"
    - "At the end of the whole thing, There will be another shorter task that I will explain after"
    - "While you are listening, fixate the cross in front of you,
    - fake task  (Nozaradan et al., 2018) : listen closely to the sound and tell me if something has changed (Tell the participant at the end the task was fake)


4. EEG preprocessing :
  1. Electrode Interpolation :
      - Interpolate disconnected (flat or noisy) electrodes, (don't forget to write them down during the recording)
      --> complicated for electrodes on the extremities (ex : PO8) because the interpolation is not spherical
      --> so interpolate vs delete ? Would make the comparison between different datasets complicated ?
      --> Runica should be ok as it is infomax
      --> Make sure to take out the electrode already interpolated from the pool (usually next to each other so will be in the algorithm for interpolation)

      Electrode Rejection :
        - Better to keep the maximum number possible of electrodes for ICA

  2. Rereferencing
  - A good reference should optimize the signal-to-noise ratio
  - In BioSemi, the reference while recording is automatically DM
  - Review "if the CI is unilateral, the best reference electrode is usually an inactive site placed along the isopotential line of the artifact within contralateral electrodes"
  - contralateral frontal electrodes have the minimum residual artifacts (but cannot be used in this case ?)


- Au niveau de l'interpolation : compliqué lorsqu'il s'agit
ICA :
- Is it ok to use Runica ?
- Maximum number of components
- Manually reject components based on topography (CI + eye blinks)

Artifact
- Order of magnitude 8μV vs 1μV for neural response (Minah 2017)
- degree and spread of contamination is dependent on the surgical emplacement of the CI (Minah 2017)

Template substraction :



5. Stimulus analysis ?
Cochlear model = need to take into account the Stimulation rate of the CI
